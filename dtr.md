Project: 2DoBox Pivot (Mod 1, FEE)

Group Member Names: Jason Collins & Kristi Green

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
 - Kristi: wants to learn how to refactor efficiently and learn more about the functionality of the application
 - Jason: implementing more array prototypes, based on feedback in last eval

Goals and expectations:
 - Kristi: refactor this in a way that she understands, come away with a better understanding of prototypes and implementation methods, along with a functioning product.
 - Jason: practicing pairing in the role of the more experienced developer

Team strengths:
 - Kristi: quickly picks up new things, good at communicating when she doesn't understand, strong understanding of HTML & CSS. Writes clean, organized code.
 - Jason: Good at explaining concepts, strong at JavaScript, very thorough when it comes to understanding features and accounting for edge case

How to overcome obstacles:
 - Kristi: communication is important
 - Jason: communication is the most important thing. And being open-minded about change.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
 - Kristi: Slack, Waffle, Zoom as tools. Communicate code changes.
 - Jason: Slack, Waffle, Zoom as tools. Communicate about changes being pushed into the repo, and notification to each other when there is new code to pull from master.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
 - Kristi: Articulating what it is she is not understanding can be a challenge. Wants to improve on functional JS understanding and array prototypes. Applying what has been learned in Mythical Creatures to a real world app.
 - Jason: Strong at writing clean code, and refactoring. Wants to work on incorporating array prototypes more.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
 - Kristi: Try to split the load as evenly as possible.
 - Jason: Try to split the load as evenly as possible.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
 - Kristi: Use branches for features, everything is PR'd, communicate when merges are needed or when master is updated.
 - Jason: Use branches for features, everything is PR'd, communicate when merges are needed or when master is updated.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
 - Kristi: Be kind, respectful, use a respectful tone.
 - Jason: All of the above, and also be able to give specific examples in feedback to help make things actionable.

Agenda to discuss project launch:
 0. Monday evening at 7pm.
 1. Set up forked repo
 2. Build waffle project and connect to repo
 3. Waffle tutorial
 4. Practice our github workflow with some JS refactoring

Ideas:

Tools:
 - Slack, Zoom, Waffle, GitHub

Additional Notes:
 - Kristi would like to navigate on JS refactoring to get more practice at it. Jason would like to refactor the HTML and CSS to get more practice with it.
